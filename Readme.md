# Game Library 

GameLibraryProject is fundamentally listing games that are in the past and the latest ones. This app consists of;

✔️ Customized onboarding screen,<br> 
✔️ Game list page, you can search a specific game or show all of them by scrolling downward, <br>
✔️ Pagination, filtering <br>
✔️ MVC, <br>
✔️ Page view for the games in header, <br>
✔️ Coredata, <br>
✔️ You can mark as favourite whichever game you want and then you can see them in a collection view all listed in your library <br>
✔️ Displaying the detail view of the game when you click, 

👉 This was a project that I made during Turkcell Geleceği Yazanlar Bootcamp. <br><br>
